KINGSIDE

This is some chess AI starter code. Contained within is a stripped down version
of Donna. What's left is a barebones board representation, a position evaluator
that just counts pieces, and a searcher that always returns the first valid move.

GETTING STARTED

You will need Go v1.3 or later (see https://golang.org/doc/install). Simply run
`make` to build.

Kingside can be used with any chess GUI software that supports UCI protocol
(such as pychess or cutechess). You can also launch kingside as standalone
command-line program and play against it in interactive mode: `./kingside -i`.

NEXT STEPS

1. `git grep TODO`. Implement an evaluator (just add up piece values) and
searcher (negamax: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax). (Ignore the
insufficient material draw todo for now.)
2. Browse https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/
3. Implement alpha-beta pruning
4. Implement a better evaluator
5. Implement an opening book using book.go and
